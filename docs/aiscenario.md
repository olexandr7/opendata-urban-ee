# Scenario 2 - Artificial Intelligence

Aksinia is a curator at Narva Castle, interested in improving the cityscape of Narva by installing a multitude of minigardens across the currently delapidated areas. Before filing an external funding proposal, she wishes to collect data on potential garden spots, planned city greenery expenses for upcoming fiscal year and available air quality measurements across city districts. 

## Workflow

Aksinia accesses the AI-enhanced Narva open data portal and types in multiple questions in natural language. Sophisticated software accesses available datasets and produces the concise number-infused narrative as well as crafted map of Narva with proposed garden locations and suitability scores. 


# Technology
 
Natural Language-based data storytelling solutions are already available on the market and are featured in latest generation of business intelligence tools like Tableau [(Ask Data)](https://www.tableau.com/products/new-features/ask-data) and MicroStrategy [(Natural Language Query)](https://community.microstrategy.com/s/article/Natural-Language-Query-in-A-Nutshell-MicroStrategy-11-0?language=en_US). Overall idea is that user types in the desired question and the underlying AI-based engine provides an answer in form of suitable vizualzation or story in plain words. There also several standalone providers of embedded natural language processing, with most prominent according to Forrester Research being [Automated Insights](https://automatedinsights.com/natural-language-generation/) and [Narrative Science](https://narrativescience.com/).
